It also contain the analysis script named "analyzer.py" that works like referred to in description.

### frontend
React application. in App.js, React takes data of tweets from API and embed them.

## analysis method
Code shown as below is performed under analyzer.py 
~~~
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('tweet_data.csv') # a data list from twitter API contains number of followers and favorites.
df = df[df["followers"] != 0].sort_values("followers")

x = df["followers"]
y = df["fav"]

plt.plot(x, y, "o")

def reg1dim(x, y):
    n = len(x)
    a = ((np.dot(x, y)- y.sum() * x.sum()/n)/
        ((x ** 2).sum() - x.sum()**2 / n))
    b = (y.sum() - a * x.sum())/n
    return a, b

a, b = reg1dim(x, y)

print(a)
print(b)

plt.plot(x, a * x + b)

plt.xscale('log')
plt.yscale('log')
plt.xlabel('follower')
plt.ylabel('favorite')
plt.grid(which='both')

![follower-favorite](./followers-fav.png)
~~~
buz_factors = [] 
# Popularity Index. introduced by calculating the ratio of the number of favorites of each tweet to avarage number of it.

for i in range(len(df)):
    factor = y.values[i] / (a * x.values[i] + b)
    buz_factors.append(factor)

df["buz_factors"] = buz_factors

x = df["followers"]
y = df["buz_factors"]

plt.plot(x, y, "o")

plt.xscale('log')
plt.yscale('log')
plt.xlabel('followers')
plt.ylabel('popularity')
plt.grid(which='both')
~~~
![follower-popularity](./followers-popularity.png)  
If popularity is 10^2, that tweet has 100 times as many favorites as avarage.
